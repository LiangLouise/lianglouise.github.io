Though I have been working on C and C++ over the Linux platform for a few years, it’s my very first time working with MSVC over the Windows platform and this library. I knew that Visual C++ projects can be quite challenging to deal with, and as soon as I saw that this library is in maintenance mode, I could feel it would cause a lot of trouble.</description></item></channel></rss>
