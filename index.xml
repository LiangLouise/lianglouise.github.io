Though I have been working on C and C++ over the Linux platform for a few years, it’s my very first time working with MSVC over the Windows platform and this library. I knew that Visual C++ projects can be quite challenging to deal with, and as soon as I saw that this library is in maintenance mode, I could feel it would cause a lot of trouble.</description></item><item><title>Extend the disk size of a Debian qcow2</title><link>https://lianglouise.github.io/post/extend_debian/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 22:38:31 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://lianglouise.github.io/post/extend_debian/</guid><description>Recently I am working on a project requiring me to pack some QEMU images for the CI purpose. As it&amp;rsquo;s going be a VM which requires almost no changes after it&amp;rsquo;s configured, I was hoping to minimize it as much as possible. The OS image I need to use is the Debian 12 image from the official Debian release repo.
The softwares I installed required some disk space around 2G, which is more than the original disk space the image initially configured, so I decided to extend the disk to allocate more space directly as I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to create an extra img file for this work.</description></item><item><title>QUIC Address Validation</title><link>https://lianglouise.github.io/post/quic_address_validation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 22:42:56 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://lianglouise.github.io/post/quic_address_validation/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9000" target="_blank">QUIC&lt;/a> is a new transport protocol meant to be the replacement of the TCP + TLS, which is on top of UDP. Other the security mechanisms provided by TLS, QUIC itself has offered an extension for an endpoint to do an identity verification to the remote endpoint, to prevent from traffic amplification attack. It&amp;rsquo;s called address validation, and it would be done along side with initial handshakes between client and server. This post will briefly talked about how this is done within QUIC.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QPACK Guide</title><link>https://lianglouise.github.io/post/qpack_guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 22:01:34 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://lianglouise.github.io/post/qpack_guide/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9204.html" target="_blank">QPACK&lt;/a> is a header field compression format for HTTP/3 that makes HTTP/2’s HPACK header compression format compatible with the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9000/" target="_blank">QUIC protocol&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In HTTP/3, the way the sender&amp;rsquo;s encoder and the receiver&amp;rsquo;s decoder reach agreement on the the state of the dynamic table for compression would be very different compared to HTTP/2. In this post, I would like to talk some of understanding I gained while I was reading the RFC and implementing QPACK.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hash Table in Pintos</title><link>https://lianglouise.github.io/post/hash_table_in_pintos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lianglouise.github.io/post/hash_table_in_pintos/</guid><description>&lt;p>Apart from the &lt;a href="https://lianglouise.github.io/post/6.list_in_pintos/">linked list&lt;/a>, there is another handful structure offered by Pintos kernel library - &lt;em>Hash Table&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Email and GPG Keys</title><link>https://lianglouise.github.io/gpg_email/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lianglouise.github.io/gpg_email/</guid><description>You can reach out to me through my university email royliang5@gmail.com (with the email&amp;rsquo;s GPG Key).

Which xxx is the best? Which xxx do you recommend? Do you think what&amp;rsquo;s the best xxx of 2021? xxx here can be substituted by any type of screenplays, i.e. movies, TV series, TV show and etc. This rule applies to one type of screenplays as well - TV anime.
In this post, I would present my analysis on what&amp;rsquo;s most welcomed TV animes in different period of time and what are the potential features make them become popular among viewers, with the help the data from anime community in Reddit and anime record data.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://lianglouise.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lianglouise.github.io/about/</guid><description>I am a recent graduate from University of Toronto Scarborough.

Finally! At the end of 2019, I managed to launched my personal blog with the help of Hexo and archer theme. with the help of Hugo and Fuji theme.
I will share my naive thoughts and experiences on coding here. 😜
Hope you could find something helpful and interesting.</description></item></channel></rss>
